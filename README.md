## Intro
---
**Docker is a platform** that allows developers to easily develop, deploy, and run applications in a containerized environment. Docker containers are lightweight, flexible, and can be run on any operating system. They allow developers to package an application with all of its dependencies into a single, portable container, ensuring that the application runs consistently in any environment. This makes it easier to manage and deploy applications, as well as streamline the development process.

While **monolithic architecture** is a single, tightly-integrated unit, microservices are made up of loosely-coupled, independently deployable components. Microservices allow for better scalability, flexibility and maintainability, but require additional complexity in communication and orchestration between services.

On the other hand, **microservices** represent a way of building applications where components are small, independent and communicate through simple APIs. Each microservice is responsible for a specific business capability and works as a separate, independent component. This allows for easy scaling and modification of individual services without affecting the functionality of other services.

### Microservices Risks
| it's important to note that microservices come with their own risk factors preinstalled.
- unnecessary complexity
- changes impact numerous services
- complex security
